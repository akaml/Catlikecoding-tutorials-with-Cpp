# CatlikecodingWithCpp
## [Catlikecoding](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/) unity3D tutorials' implementation in C++ and [Ogre3D](https://www.ogre3d.org/about). A nice way to get introduced to Ogre3D.

### Motivation:
* [Catlikecoding tutorials](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/) build on one another, introducing new programming concepts, math, and algorithms. It is fun.
* Why not implement these project ideas with C++ - will have one more practice ground for learning C++.
* Will be a nice way to get used to and learn [Ogre3D](https://www.ogre3d.org/about).

## A beautiful book open sourced - for physically based rendering:
* Photorealistic computer graphics is ubiquitous today, with applications that include entertainment—notably, movies and video games; product design; and architecture. Donald Knuth wrote “This book has deservedly won an Academy Award. I believe it should also be nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.” Read about the book [Physically Based Rendering](http://www.pbr-book.org/), which will link you to the contents of the book to [Physically Based Rendering:Contents](http://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/contents.html).
And more fun - here is the [source code used by the book](https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3).

### How?
* Use a 3D engine written in C++ - obvious choice is [Ogre3D](https://www.ogre3d.org/about) - to implement [catlikecoding tutorials](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/) in C++.
* Get to know more of Ogre3D by following [Ogre3D tutorials](http://wiki.ogre3d.org/Tutorials).
* And worth mentioning is [a list of recommended programming-related books from Ogre3D](http://wiki.ogre3d.org/Recommended+reading) for Graphics, Game and C++ programming.

### Getting Started :
* Start by doing [Ogre3D tutorials](http://wiki.ogre3d.org/Tutorials).
* Start doing [catlikecoding tutorials](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/) in Ogre3D and C++ alongside progression with Ogre3D.

# Have Fun =)
