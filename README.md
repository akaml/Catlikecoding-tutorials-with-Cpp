# CatlikecodingWithCpp
# [Catlikecoding](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/) Unity tutorials in C++. A nice way to get introduced to Ogre3D.

# Motivation:
* [Catlikecoding tutorials](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/) build on one another, introducing new programming concepts, math, and algorithms. It is fun.
* Why not implement these project ideas with C++ - will have one more practice ground for learning C++.
* Will be a nice way to get used to and learn [Ogre3D](https://www.ogre3d.org/about).

# How?
* Use a 3D engine written in C++ - obvious choice is [Ogre3D](https://www.ogre3d.org/about) - to implement [catlikecoding tutorials](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/) in C++.\
* Get to know more of Ogre3D by following [Ogre3D tutorials](http://wiki.ogre3d.org/Tutorials).
* And worth mentioning is [A list of recommended programming-related books](http://wiki.ogre3d.org/Recommended+reading) from Ogre3D for Graphics, Game and C++ programming.

# Getting Started :
* Start by doing [Ogre3D tutorials](http://wiki.ogre3d.org/Tutorials).
* Start doing [catlikecoding tutorials](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/) in Ogre3D and C++ alongside progression with Ogre3D.

# Have Fun =)
